# 🌟 A Very Big Sum 🌟

## 📖 Overview

The **A Very Big Sum** function calculates the sum of an array of integers, which may be quite large. This challenge emphasizes the need to handle large numbers that can exceed the range of standard 32-bit integers.

## 🛠️ Function Description

### `aVeryBigSum(long[] ar)`

- **Parameters:**

  - `long[] ar`: An array of integers (potentially very large numbers).

- **Returns:**
  - `long`: The sum of all elements in the array.

## 📊 Example

### Input

```
5
1000000001 1000000002 1000000003 1000000004 1000000005

```

**Output:**

```java
5000000015
```

### Explanation

```
The solution reads an array of large integers, calculates their sum using a loop,

and returns the total as a long integer to handle potential overflow


The sum is calculated as:
`1000000001 + 1000000002 + 1000000003 + 1000000004 + 1000000005 = 5000000015.

```
